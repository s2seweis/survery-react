# Good to know: 
- In this approach, styles are imported as a module, and specific class names (styles.formContainer, styles.inputField, styles.button) are used for each element. 
- These class names are scoped to this component, ensuring they won't conflict with styles in other parts of your application.
- See Contact.js and Contact.css.
