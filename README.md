# Survey App with React and Firebase

This project is a simple survey application built using React for the front-end and Firebase for the back-end.

## Features

- **Authentication:** Users can sign up and log in to participate in surveys.
- **Survey Creation:** Admin can create custom surveys with multiple-choice questions.
- **Survey Participation:** Users can participate in surveys by selecting their answers.
- **Survey Results:** Admin can view the survey results in real-time.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Firebase:** A cloud-based platform for building mobile and web applications.
  - **Firebase Authentication:** For user authentication.
  - **Cloud Firestore:** A NoSQL database to store survey data.
- **SurveyJS:** A JavaScript survey library for building interactive surveys and forms.
